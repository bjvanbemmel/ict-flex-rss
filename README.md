# ICT-Flex-RSS
The goal of this project is to turn https://ict-flex.nl/category/mededelingen/ into a proper RSS feed.

## Why?
The only way for students to take notice of new announcements is by manually going to the website at just the right time.
To make sure that people no longer miss important announcements, there must be a feed in a universal format (such as RSS) that allows bots (e.g. Discord bots) to interact with it.

This project has no official affilitation with ICT-Flex or Deltion College.
